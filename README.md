# Super_Resolution_Object_Dection_on_Self_Driving_Automotives

## Intro

Super-resolution object dection on self-driving automotives. Using YoLo as representitives of general object detection model with official provided pre-trained weights and transfer learning on self-driving automotives datasets. Using SRGAN with pre-trained weights to increase the object detection accuracy (lowering false-positive and false-negtive detections) by super-res-ing entire or partical section of the detection sample frame. Tring to build an algorithm to determin which video frame to super-res or which image section to super-res. Less frequent of performing super-resolution, better model performence on processing speed.
